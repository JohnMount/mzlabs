## Fun Writing

Some little rants and essays from over the years. In no particular order.


### [John Mount's Trouble Free Crab Recipe](crab.md)

A real-life culinary adventure from grad school. Originally posted to one of the university bboards, eventually appeared in one of the early issues of *Slow: the magazine of the slow food movement* (March 1996). Apparently they seeded the magazine early on by scraping the web; the article appeared just like this, eccentric punctuation and everything. I'm not sure the magazine still exists, but [the organization does](https://www.slowfood.com/).


### Gerty: a character in Duncan Jones's *Moon*

A comparison of Gerty to earlier science fiction figures (including the obvious...).

### [Good Stationery as a Tool of Thought](Stationery.md)

The advantages of old-school, quality pen-and-paper over keyboard for creative tasks. Written in 2013. Kind of a companion piece to Nina Zumel's [*I Write, Therefore I Think*](https://ninazumel.com/2012/10/11/i-write-therefore-i-think/).

### *Star Wars*: It's a Good Life

On the *Star Wars* - *Twilight Zone* connection.

### [Consumers Value Washing Their Jeans](jeans.md)

Fortunately, Levis doesn't use this circa 2014 ad campaign anymore. Do they?
