title: 'KnotEd: A Knot Editor'

This is some software I originally developed as part of an undergraduate thesis at UC Berkeley back in the eighties. I've updated it intermittently over the years as the C language has evolved.

The most recent version of the code (which is still pretty old) is [now up on Github](https://github.com/JohnMount/knotEd). Here's a video of the code in action:

I used the [Conway knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_knot) in the video on honor of [Dr. Lisa Piccirillo's recent solution to the Conway Knot Slice question](https://www.quantamagazine.org/graduate-student-solves-decades-old-conway-knot-problem-20200519/). She published her result in [*Annals of Mathematics*](https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2020/191-2/p05), Volume 191, 2020.
